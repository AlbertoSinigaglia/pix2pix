# Pix2Pix implementation

This repository contains the code to implement Pix2Pix in Tensorflow using multiple different network architectures:
 - CNN Autoencoder
 - Deep CNN 
 - U-Net
 - Res-Net
 - Dense-Net

which can be trained either with a regression loss (L1/L2), with a generative loss (GAN), or with a linear combination of the two (Pix2Pix)
